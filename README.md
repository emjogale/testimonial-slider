## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I tried to make the slider as accessible as possible as I have read that they are notoriously not very accessible.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

- I need to do more research on accessibility.
- I continue to find the sizing and positioning of background images tricky so need to do more research in this area.

### Useful resources

- [How to build a more accessible carousel or slider](https://dev.to/jasonwebb/how-to-build-a-more-accessible-carousel-or-slider-35lp) - I found this article helpful.
